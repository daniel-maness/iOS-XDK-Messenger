# Atlas Messenger Changelog

## 1.0.0-pre1

### New Features

1. New, improved UI with XDK UI components.

### Known Issues

1. When creating new conversation, identities list items donâ€™t have selected state. Selecting participants for new conversation is possible, but is not visible.
2. Creating and presenting new conversation crashes app. As a temporary workaround a status message is sent to each new conversation, so after restarting app it remains on conversations list.
