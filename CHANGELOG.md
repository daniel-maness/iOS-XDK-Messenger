# Atlas Messenger Changelog

## 1.0.0-pre1

### New Features

1. New, improved UI with XDK UI components.

### Known Issues

1. When creating new conversation, identities list items donâ€™t have selected state. Selecting participants for new conversation is possible, but is not visible.
2. Creating and presenting new conversation crashes app. As a temporary workaround a status message is sent to each new conversation, so after restarting app it remains on conversations list.

## 1.0.0-pre2

### Enhancements

1. Updated LayerXDK/UI and LayerKit to 1.0.0-pre2 versions. Please refer to [LayerXDK changelog](https://github.com/layerhq/iOS-XDK/releases/tag/v1.0.0-pre2) and [LayerKit changelog](https://github.com/layerhq/releases-ios/releases/tag/v1.0.0-pre2) respectively.

### Bugfixes

1. Fixed instastart configuration, when downloading pre-configured app form Layer dashboard.
